##The Future of Digital Assets

While Bitcoin is the most recognizable digital asset, it’s just one asset class among many that are here to evolve financial services globally.

While change is guaranteed, the scale and scope of that change are not. For the financial industry, blockchain — the technology that undergirds Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and other digital assets — has brought us to the crossroads.

Blockchain offers a faster, more efficient and more secure structure for financial transactions when compared with the contracts, transactions and records that currently define our economic, legal and political systems.

From generation to generation, technologies have updated how we complete financial transactions. The modern credit card has been around since the late 1950s, the first proper sale over the internet was completed in 1994, PayPal was founded in 1998 and went public and was sold to eBay in 2002, and Satoshi Nakamoto started the blockchain revolution in 2008.

The success of any financial market is based on predictability, security and general market efficiency, regulators continue to contemplate the direction and viability of their involvement with cryptocurrencies.

Regulators and businesses want to ensure that investors enjoy certain protections in any marketplace — digital or otherwise — to spark participation. Without regulation, market participants can be exposed to long- and short-term risks.

And, importantly, it’s not just regulators and governments that will decide the future — it is about us, investors, leaders and the general consumer — deciding how we want to use digital assets in the future.
