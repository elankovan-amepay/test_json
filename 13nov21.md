## NFTs presence in the market

The next few years are likely to be very interesting, as the non-fungible token market opens digital collectibles for fans and investors.

Celebrities are embracing NFTs in a big way.

The nonfungible token (NFT) market is growing. According to a new report by analytics platform DappRadar, NFT trade volume soared past $10 billion during the third quarter of 2021, a sevenfold increase from the previous quarterâ€™s figure. Although a significant slice of that action comes from runaway hits like NBA Top Shot, CryptoPunks and gaming platform Axie Infinity, NFT use cases are rapidly proliferating as creators recognize their potential.

In the not-too-distant past, celebrities keen to profit from the burgeoning crypto scene had few options. Mostly, they were limited to shilling an initial coin offering (ICO) or investing their own money in a startup they deemed promising. Thanks to NFTs, however, they can now leverage their star appeal by releasing sought-after digital collectibles representing, well, just about anything: artwork, albums, trading cards, or merchandise. These tokenized collectibles can then, in turn, be traded on the open market among fans and investors.

With strong utility based cryptocurrency, AMEPAY has launched its own NFT Market place with a wide variety of digital collectibles.

AME token is the prime mode of payments in the AMEPAY NFT Market place. Visit nft.amepay.io for more details.
